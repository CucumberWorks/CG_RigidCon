# CG_RigidCon
A 3D-printable controller upgrade for the contact glove

# Important: Before before you start
This project started as a very personal modification using the existing button and joystick components from the contact glove by diver-x.

Model based on the CAD files kindly offered by diver-x.

You are expected to heavily modify some of the components, although all modifications are designed to be modular and not destructive to the contact glove itself.

If you are not familiar with 3D printing or working with hardware in general, some of the steps might be challenging.

Overall the project is still at a quite alpha state. 

# Before you start
You need a decent 3D printer. Most modern FDM machines will do. SLA printers will not work due to the use of threaded inserts and the fragility of resin. I printed the parts on a Prusa Mini and a A1 mini. Sufficient part cooling is required, as it will help with support removal. You only need PLA for these parts. Personal recomendation is PLA-CF. the carbon fiber reinforcement will further increase PLA's rigidity and help support removal easier. Use thick outerwalls(>4) for better strength. You may also use high infill(50%) to improve layer adhesion. 0.4mm nozzle for all parts but you can use 0.6mm for large structural components.

Heat inserts are used for threads. M3x3 and M3x5. Will probably move to locknuts.

Magnets are 4mm(D)x5mm(H) N52.

CA glue used to secure the magnets. Get a CA glue curing accelerator for a better experience. My personal recommendation is the Cyanon DW. High viscosity and easy to work with.

8mm elastic bands are used to help support the assembly even during active sessions.
