A 3D-printable controller upgrade for the contact glove

# Important: Before you start
This project started as a very personal modification using the existing button and joystick components from the contact glove by diver-x.

Model based on the CAD files kindly offered by diver-x.

You are expected to heavily modify some of the components, although all modifications are designed to be modular and not destructive to the contact glove itself.

If you are not familiar with 3D printing or working with hardware in general, some of the steps might be challenging.

Overall the project is still at a quite alpha state.
